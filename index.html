		<p> 

			<a href="https://meng.house.gov/">U.S. Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY)</a>, represents New York's 6th Congressional District, which consists of neighborhoods in West, Central and Northeast Queens. Currently serving her sixth term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Meng is an advocate for policies that will best help underserved and vulnerable communities. Her current term ends in January of 2025. Meng is running for re-election to the U.S. House, and she is on the ballot for the upcoming general election on Nov. 5, 2024. Explained below is Meng's stance on <a href="https://www.gracefornewyork.com/issues">issues</a> that have been recently discussed or debated leading up to the election next month.
		</p>

		<!-- Topic 1 -->
		<h2> Health Care </h2>

		<p>
			As one of the founding members of the Medicare for All Congressional Caucus, Rep. Meng cosponsored the Medicare for All Acts of 2019 and 2023. The updated <a href="https://jayapal.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JAYAPA_019_xml-Medicare-for-All-118th-Final32023.pdf">2023 bill</a> would expand the Medicare program to be able to provide comprehensive benefits to all people in the United States. Furthermore, Meng voted in favor of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which was signed into law by President Biden in 2022. In terms of its impact on the American health care system, the act:

			<ul>
				<li> Allows Medicare to negotiate the price of certain prescription drugs beginning in 2026, </li>
				<li> Capped the cost of insulin at $35 for patients on Medicare, </li> 
				<li> Limits the annual out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugs to $2000 for seniors beginning in 2025, </li>
				<li> Extends subsidies through 2025 for people who purchase individual coverage through the Affordable Care Act, </li>
				<li>and Allows seniors to receive certain recommended adult vaccines, like the shingles and pneumonia vaccines, for free. </li>
			</ul>

		</p>

		<!-- Topic 2 -->
		<h2> Women's Rights </h2>

		<p>
			At the Democratic National Convention in August, Meng spoke out against Trump's plan for reproductive rights, and voiced her support for women having access to abortion care. She has also championed other women's rights initiatives surrounding menstrual equity and menstrual health education. Within the past two years, Meng has sponsored the following bills and resolutions:
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8829/text?s=2&r=36">H.R. 8829</a> - Menstrual Products Right To Know Act of 2022, </li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5957/text?s=1&r=84">H.R. 5957</a> - Robin Danielson Menstrual Product and Intimate Care Product Safety Act of 2023, </li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3646/text?s=2&r=14">H.R. 3646</a> - Menstrual Equity For All Act of 2023, </li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/1248/text?s=2&r=27">H.Res.1248</a> - Recognizing the impact the stigmatization of menstruation has on the lives of women, girls and people who menstruate, and expressing support for the designation of May as "National Menstrual Health Awareness Month", </li>
			</ul>

			all of which aim to address period poverty, increase access to menstrual products, and spread awareness about menstrual health.

		</p>

		<!-- Topic 3 -->
		<h2> Education </h2>

		<p>
			
			Meng says that education is a human right, and that all children, whether they live in the United States or another country, should be able to receive a high quality, affordable education. For individuals who want to receive a higher education, she has sought to forgive student debt and make it easier the pay off student loans, secure more funding for federal programs that provide students with financial aid, and help make a college education affordable to all. In her work to address the issue of lack of access to education following the COVID-19 pandemic, Meng also worked to secure funding for the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-connectivity-fund">Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF)</a> to ensure that schools and libraries can provide students with the necessary tools for remote learning, including internet access and technological devices.

		</p>

		<!-- Topic 4 -->
		<h2> Gun Violence Prevention </h2>

		<p>
			As a member of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Representative Meng has worked to secure federal funding for research and programs, sponsored legislation, and called for Republican leaders to help improve gun safety and combat gun violence. In 2019, she voted for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8/text">H.R. 8</a>), which aimed to require background checks on all gun sales, and the Enhanced Background Checks Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1112/text">H.R. 1112</a>), which aimed to close the "Charleston loophole". Most recently in 2023, Meng reintroduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3247/text?s=2&r=18">Aaron Salter Jr. Responsible Body Armor Possession Act</a> to the House, which would prohibit civilians from purchasing, owning or possessing enhanced body armor, unless they are members of law enforcement, military personnel, or they use such equipment for work.
